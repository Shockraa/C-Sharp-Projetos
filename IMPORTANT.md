<h1 align="center">Hello, about the structure.</h1>
<p>Most of the exercises I've done are from "Fundamentals of Computer Programming With C#" book, they are organized inside the "src" folder and by chapter, which are from the book. The numbers that are in front of the files are related to the exercise's number.</p>
<p>Also, the 00 folder are not related to the book, they're related to my course</p>
<p>I am still organizing</p>
